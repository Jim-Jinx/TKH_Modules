1. What is Git and how is it different from Github
   1. Git is a version control tool that we use to track coding changes within a project. Github is a platform that hosts repositories (a.k.a projects) that we can integrate with Git. Github allows one to share repositories, collaborate, and pull changes while presenting an overarching portfolio.
